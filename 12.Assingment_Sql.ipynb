    "#### Database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of the data. It provides a mechanism for managing and organizing vast amounts of information.\n",
    "#### SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that handle data in different ways:\n",
    "#### SQL Databases:\n",
    "#### 1. Structure: SQL databases are based on the relational model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas. Each table consists of rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys.\n",
    "#### 2. Schema: SQL databases have a rigid schema that defines the structure of the data. The schema specifies the types of data that can be stored in the database and enforces constraints on data integrity.\n",
    "#### 3. Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for managing and querying data. SQL provides a set of declarative commands (such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to perform operations on the database.\n",
    "#### 4. ACID Properties: SQL databases typically adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure data consistency and reliability.\n",
    "#### 5. Scaling: SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increased workloads by adding more resources to a single server. However, scaling horizontally (across multiple servers) can be complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "#### 1. Structure: NoSQL databases employ various data models, including key-value stores, document stores, columnar databases, and graph databases. They provide flexibility by allowing unstructured or semi-structured data storage.\n",
    "#### 2. Schema: NoSQL databases are often schema-less, meaning the data does not require a predefined structure. This flexibility allows for easier handling of evolving data models and dynamic schemas.\n",
    "#### 3. Query Language: NoSQL databases may use different query languages depending on the database type. Some NoSQL databases have their own query languages specific to their data model, while others support a subset of SQL or provide APIs for querying and manipulation.\n",
    "#### 4. ACID Properties: NoSQL databases often relax the ACID properties in favor of performance and scalability. They may provide eventual consistency, where data consistency is achieved over time rather than instantly.\n",
    "#### 5. Scaling: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, allowing for distributed computing across multiple servers. They can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads by adding more servers to the system."

    "#### DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for defining and managing the structure of a database. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here are explanations and examples of commonly used DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or procedures. It specifies the structure and properties of the object being created. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```sql\n",
    "        CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "           id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "           name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "           department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "        ); ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### This example creates a table called \"employees\" with columns for \"id\", \"name\", and \"department\". The \"id\" column is defined as the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. DROP: The DROP statement is used to remove database objects. It permanently deletes the specified object from the database. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "#### This example drops the \"employees\" table from the database, including all the data stored within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure or properties of existing database objects. It allows you to add, modify, or drop columns, constraints, or other attributes of a table. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "   ADD COLUMN salary DECIMAL(10,2);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This example adds a new column called \"salary\" to the \"employees\" table, which can store decimal numbers with a precision of 10 and a scale of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all the data from a table while keeping the table structure intact. It is a faster alternative to deleting all the rows using the DELETE statement. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This example removes all the data from the \"employees\" table, but the table itself remains in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary, DDL statements (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE) are used for managing the structure and properties of database objects. CREATE is used to create new objects, DROP is used to delete objects, ALTER is used to modify objects, and TRUNCATE is used to remove all data from a table. These statements provide the means to define and manipulate the structure of a database to meet the specific requirements of an application."

    "\n",
    "#### This example inserts a new row into the \"employees\" table with values for the \"id\", \"name\", and \"department\" columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data within a table. It allows us to change the values of specific columns in one or more rows. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   UPDATE employees\n",
    "   SET department = 'Marketing'\n",
    "   WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This example updates the \"department\" column in the \"employees\" table for the row where the \"id\" is 1. The value of the \"department\" column is changed to 'Marketing'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove specific rows of data from a table. It allows us to delete one or more rows based on specified conditions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DELETE FROM employees\n",
    "   WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This example deletes the row from the \"employees\" table where the \"id\" is 1."

    "\n",
    "#### Consider a table called \"Employees\" with the following structure:\n",

    "| 1          | John      | Doe      | Sales      | 50000  |\n",

    "| 4          | Lisa      | Brown    | HR         | 45000  |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To retrieve specific information from this table, we can use the SELECT statement with appropriate clauses. Here's an example:\n",

    "SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Department = 'Sales';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the SELECT statement example:\n",
    "1. **SELECT**: It indicates that we want to retrieve specific columns from the table.\n",
    "2. **FirstName, LastName, Salary**: These are the columns we want to select and retrieve data from.\n",
    "3. **FROM Employees**: It specifies the table from which we want to retrieve the data. In this case, it's the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "4. **WHERE Department = 'Sales'**: It defines a condition to filter the data. In this example, we only want to retrieve records where the \"Department\" column value is equal to 'Sales'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The result of the above SELECT statement would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "| FirstName | LastName | Salary |\n",
    "|-----------|----------|--------|\n",
    "| John      | Doe      | 50000  |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The SELECT statement retrieves the first name, last name, and salary of employees who work in the Sales department. It filters the data based on the condition specified in the WHERE clause and returns the matching rows."

    "#### In database management systems, primary keys and foreign keys are two important concepts that establish relationships between tables and ensure data integrity. Let's explore each concept in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Primary Key:\n",
    "#### A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record or row. It ensures that each row in the table has a unique identifier, and no two rows can have the same primary key value. Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Uniqueness: A primary key must contain unique values for each row in the table.\n",
    "#### - Non-nullability: A primary key column cannot have null values.\n",
    "#### - Indexing: Primary keys are typically automatically indexed by the database system for faster retrieval and efficient data management.\n",
    "#### - Data Integrity: Primary keys enforce data integrity by preventing duplicate records and ensuring the uniqueness of each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "#### Consider a table called \"Students\" with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "| StudentID | Name   | Age | Gender |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|-----|--------|\n",
    "| 1         | John   | 20  | Male   |\n",
    "| 2         | Jane   | 22  | Female |\n",
    "| 3         | Mike   | 21  | Male   |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this case, the \"StudentID\" column can be designated as the primary key. Each value in the \"StudentID\" column is unique and serves as the identifier for each student record.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Foreign Key:\n",
    "#### A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of one table as a foreign key in another table. The purpose of a foreign key is to maintain referential integrity and enforce relationships between related tables. Here are some key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Relationship: A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, representing a dependency or association.\n",
    "#### - Referential Integrity: A foreign key ensures that the values in the referencing table (child table) correspond to existing values in the referenced table (parent table).\n",
    "#### - Cascading Actions: Foreign keys can have cascading actions such as ON DELETE or ON UPDATE, which specify how changes in the referenced table should propagate to the referencing table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Consider two tables, \"Students\" and \"Courses,\" with the following structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Students Table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| StudentID | Name   | Age | Gender |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|-----|--------|\n",
    "| 1         | John   | 20  | Male   |\n",
    "| 2         | Jane   | 22  | Female |\n",
    "| 3         | Mike   | 21  | Male   |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Courses Table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| CourseID | CourseName | StudentID |\n",
    "|----------|------------|-----------|\n",
    "| 1        | Math       | 1         |\n",
    "| 2        | Science    | 2         |\n",
    "| 3        | English    | 1         |\n",
    "| 4        | History    | 3         |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this example, the \"StudentID\" column in the \"Courses\" table is a foreign key that references the \"StudentID\" column in the \"Students\" table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, indicating that each course is associated with a specific student.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The foreign key ensures referential integrity by only allowing values in the \"Courses\" table's \"StudentID\" column that already exist as primary key values in the \"Students\" table's \"StudentID\" column. This relationship allows us to retrieve data across related tables and maintain consistency."

    "\n",
    "#### 1. `cursor()` method: The `cursor()` method creates a cursor object that allows us to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the MySQL database. It is called on the database connection object (`mydb` in the above code) to create a new cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `execute()` method: The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL queries on the MySQL database through the cursor object. It takes the SQL query as a parameter and executes it. In the example code, the `execute()` method is used to execute the `SELECT * FROM employees` query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### After executing the query, we can fetch the results using methods like `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, or `fetchmany()`. In the example code, the `fetchall()` method is used to retrieve all the rows returned by the query.\n",
