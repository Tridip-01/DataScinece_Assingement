    "#### In Python, we can achieve data abstraction using the following techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Classes and Objects: In Python we can define classes to represent entities in code. A class encapsulates data attributes and methods that operate on those attributes. By creating objects of the class, we can access and manipulate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Access Modifiers: In Python, we can use access modifiers to control the visibility of attributes within a class. By convention, attributes that should not be accessed directly from outside the class are prefixed with an underscore (_). The underscore convention serves as a signal to other programmers that the attribute is intended to be private or internal to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Getters and Setters: Python doesn't have built-in support for traditional getters and setters like some other languages, but we can use the `@property` decorator and setter methods to achieve a similar effect. The `@property` decorator allows you to define a method as a getter, which can be used to retrieve the value of an attribute. Setter methods can be defined using the `@attribute_name.setter` decorator, which allows you to perform additional logic or validations when setting the value of an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Abstract Base Classes (ABCs): The `abc` module in Python provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes. By inheriting from `ABC` and using the `@abstractmethod` decorator, we can define abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Abstract base classes can act as interfaces, defining a contract for classes to follow, while leaving the specific implementation details to the subclasses.\n"
