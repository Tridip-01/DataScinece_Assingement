Python ignores string literals that are not assigned to a variable or used as docstrings, multi-line strings can be used as a form of multiline comments. Here's an example:\n",

    "In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. A variable is like a container that holds a value, and the value can be of various types, such as numbers, strings, lists, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a variable in Python, we simply choose a name for the variable and use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to it. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 29\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we declare a variable named x and assign it the value of 29. Now, x holds the value 29, and we can use x in our code to refer to that value.\n",

    "Python is a dynamically typed language, which means we don't need to explicitly specify the type of a variable. The type of the variable is inferred based on the value assigned to it. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "name = \"Tridip Karmakar\"  # Here, name is a string variable\n",
    "age = 26      # Here, age is an integer variable\n",
    "height = 5.10     # Here, height is a floating-point variable\n",

    "In the above example, x is first assigned the value 29, and then it is reassigned the value 39. After the reassignment, the value of x becomes 39.\n",

    "Python allows us to assign values to multiple variables in a single line using multiple assignments or unpacking. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = y = z = 0  # Assigning the value 0 to all three variables\n",
    "a, b, c = 1, 2, 3  # Unpacking: Assigning different values to multiple variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first line, the value 0 is assigned to variables x, y, and z. In the second line, different values 1, 2, and 3 are assigned to variables a, b, and c, respectively.\n"

    "\n",
    "a = 15\n",
    "b = float(a)  # b will be 15.0\n",

    "str(): This function converts a value to a string data type. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 56\n",
    "b = str(a)  # b will be \"56\"\n",
    "\n",
    "list(): This function converts an iterable or sequence to a list. For example:\n",

    "b = list(a)  # b will be [19, 78, 90]\n",

    "b = tuple(a)  # a will be (78, 88, 99)\n",

    "a = [(\"b\", 19), (\"c\", 100)]\n",
    "b = dict(a)  # b will be {\"b\": 19, \"c\": 100}\n",
    "\n",
    "bool(): This function converts a value to a boolean data type. It returns False for numeric zero values or empty containers, and True for non-zero numbers or non-empty containers. For example:\n",

    "a = 1\n",
    "b = bool(a)  # a will be True"
